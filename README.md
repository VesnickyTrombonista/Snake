# Snake
My first small game in Haskell for a university project of functional programming.
You can see documentation.md for more information, where you can find user-part and program-part as well.
It is only in Czech, but I hope everybody knows this game very well.
I was new to using Gloss, so I found helpful https://andrew.gibiansky.com/blog/haskell/haskell-gloss/.

During the installationn I had few problems, so I install cabal, random and freeglut3.

I find useful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42072958/haskell-with-opengl-unknown-glut-entry-glutinit, when I had error: user error (unknown GLUT entry glutInit).
