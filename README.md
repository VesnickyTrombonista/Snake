# Snake
My first small game in Haskell for a university project of functional programming.
For more information see documentation.md, where you can find user-part and program-part as well.
It is only in Czech, but I hope everybody knows this game very well.
I was new to using Gloss, so I was inspired by https://github.com/leonardo-ono/HaskellSnakeGame.

During the installationn I had few problems, so I install cabal, random, freeglut3 and gloss-juicy.

I find useful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42072958/haskell-with-opengl-unknown-glut-entry-glutinit, when I had error: user error (unknown GLUT entry glutInit).
