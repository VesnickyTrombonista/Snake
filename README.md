# Snake
My first small game in Haskell for a university project of functional programming.
I was new to using Gloss, so I was inspired by https://github.com/leonardo-ono/HaskellSnakeGame.

During the installationn I had few problems, so I install cabal and random and freeglut3.

I find useful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42072958/haskell-with-opengl-unknown-glut-entry-glutinit.
